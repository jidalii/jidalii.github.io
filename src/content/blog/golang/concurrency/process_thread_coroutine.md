# WTF are Coroutine, Thread, and Process

## Hierarchy relationship

- **CPU**: divided into independent **cores** for parallel processing.
- **Core**: Executes **processes**, each managed by the OS.
- **Process**: A running program with its own memory space, scheduled by the OS on a core.
- **Thread**: A lightweight execution unit within a process, sharing its memory, managed by the OS.
- **Coroutine**: A subunit of threads, offering cooperative multitasking, managed by the runtime

```go
CPU
 â”œâ”€â”€ Core 1
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Process 1A (Managed by OS)
 â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Process 1B (Managed by OS)
 â”‚            â”œâ”€â”€ Thread 1B-1 (Managed by OS)
 â”‚            â””â”€â”€ Thread 1B-2 (Managed by OS)
 â”‚                    â”œâ”€â”€ Coroutine i (Managed by runtime)
 â”‚                    â””â”€â”€ Coroutine ii (Managed by runtime)
 â””â”€â”€ Core 2
      â””â”€â”€ Process 2A (Managed by OS)
```

- A process can have **multiple threads**.
- A thread can manage **multiple coroutines**.

## Defines

### 1) process

- **Define:** Process is **an instance of an executing program**. I serves as the basic unit for resource allocation by the OS. When a process is running, it requires various resources, like CPU Time, Memory, I/O devices, to complete its execution.
- **The difference between the Process and the Program**: the Program is code in the disk waiting to be exeucted, while the Process is an executing program.
- **Pros & Cons:**
    - **Pro:**
        1. Processes are isolated from each other since each process has its own independent system resources.
        2. No data sharing issues: no need for mechanisms like locks or mutexes to prevent data races or synchronization issues.
    - **Cons:**
        1. High overhead for **process creation** and **context switching** since it invloves OS resource switching.
        2. Complex and slower Inter-Process Communication (IPC).

### WTF are concurrnecy & parallel

- **Concurrency:** manage multiple tasks that run in overlapping periods, often on a single CPU core.
- **Parallelism:** run multiple tasks simultaneously on multiple CPU cores or processors.

To better understand the difference, imagine you're in a kitchen alone, preparing dinner. While you alternate between boiling water, chopping meat, and cutting vegetables, you're practicing **concurrency** because you're managing multiple tasks but doing them one at a time. Now, if you and a friend work on these tasks simultaneouslyâ€”for instance, one boils water while the other chops meatâ€”that's **parallelism**.

### 2) thread

- **AKA:** light weight process
- **Define:** a thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process. It shares memory and resources of its parent process.
- **Pros & Cons of Multithreading:**
    - **Pros:**
        1. **Lightweight:** less overhead for **thread creation** and **context switching**, since threads share recourses.
        2. **Share memory:** threads within the same process can easily share data and resources.
    - **Cons:**
        
        **Race condition:** could lead to synchronization bugs, like deadlock, data races since threads share the same memory.
        

### 3) coroutine

- **Define:** a computer program component that allows execution to be **suspended and resumed**, enabling **non-preemptive** multitasking. As can be seen from the diagram above, Coroutine is fully controlled by **programming runtime *(a user-space scheduler)***, not the OS.
- **Features:**
    - **Lightweight:** creation requires only a few KB while Threadâ€™s creation requires a few MB.
    - **Less overhead:** less overhead for context switching.
    - **Non-preemptive scheduler:** allowing the scheduler or user-defined logic to decide when to switch tasks. But Thread is preemptive, which is scheduled by the operating system
    - **Concurrency:** Coroutine achieve concurrency while Thread achieves true parallelism when executed on multicore processes.

### 4) summary

| Feature | Process | Thread | Coroutine |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Define | An executing program with its own memory space | A lightweight process | a concurrent subroutines that are nonpreemptive |
| Managed By | OS | OS | Programming Runtime |
| Memory Space | Separate memory space | Shared within a process | Shared within a thread |
| Concurrency Type | True parallelism | True parallelism | Cooperative concurrency |
| Creation & Switch Cost | High | Moderate | Very low |

# Goroutine

### **define**

Goroutines are not OS threads not exactly coroutines. Goroutines integrate deeply with Goâ€™s runtime. While coroutines define their suspension or reentry points, goroutines donâ€™t. 

Instread, Goâ€™s runtime observes the runtime behavior of goroutines:

- automatically suspends them when they are blocked, and
- resume them when they are unblocked

This feature makes goroutines **preemptable** only when goroutines have become blocked. Thus, goroutines are **a special class of coroutines**.

### features

1. **Preemptive when when goroutines have become blocked**
2. **Lightweight and Auto-Scaling:** each goroutines only need a few KB, which is almost always enough. If isnâ€™t, the runtime grows or shrinks the memory for stroing the stack automatically.
3. **Cheap Context Switching:** context switching in software is way cheaper than that in OS.

### max number of goroutines

- **Factors of limit of the max number of goroutines:**
    1. Available memory
    2. Schedulerâ€™s ability to manage goroutines
- **Formula:** $Max\ Goroutines = RAM\ Size / Avg\ Goroutine\ Size$

<aside>
ðŸ”´

**Attention:** `GOMAXPROCS` controls max number of concurrent OS threads for goroutines, not the number of goroutines.
